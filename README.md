This repository is a bunch of beginning python programs I made when I first started learning to code. I'm publishing it because I want to help out other people who are learning how to code and may be wondering how to do things! Please realize that some of the techniques I used, while they do get the job done right, are not the most efficient way to do things. These programs were made specific ways according to specific topics being learned when made. In the future, I will be upgrading this repository with even more examples from different coding languages. Feel free to use the code however you wish, and I wish everyone the best of luck
